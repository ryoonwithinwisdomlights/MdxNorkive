## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Type everything
interface Props {
  title: string;
  count: number;
}

function Component({ title, count }: Props) {
  // ...
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Using any
function Component(props: any) {
  // ...
}
```

### React Components

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Functional component with proper types
import React from 'react';

interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}

export function Button({ label, onClick, variant = 'primary' }: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button 
      onClick={onClick}
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  );
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Class component, no types
export class Button extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <button>{this.props.label}</button>;
  }
}
```

### File Naming

```
‚úÖ Good:
- MyComponent.tsx (components)
- useMyHook.ts (hooks)
- myUtil.ts (utilities)
- my-post.mdx (content)

‚ùå Bad:
- mycomponent.tsx
- MyHook.ts (should start with 'use')
- MyUtil.ts (utilities should be camelCase)
```

### Import Order

```typescript
// 1. React and Next.js
import React from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

// 2. Third-party libraries
import { z } from 'zod';
import clsx from 'clsx';

// 3. Internal modules
import { Button } from '@/modules/common/Button';
import { useTheme } from '@/lib/hooks/useTheme';

// 4. Types
import type { Post } from '@/types/mdx.model';

// 5. Styles (if any)
import './styles.css';
```

### Naming Conventions

```typescript
// Variables: camelCase
const userName = 'John';
const isActive = true;

// Functions: camelCase
function calculateTotal() { }
const handleClick = () => { };

// Components: PascalCase
function MyComponent() { }
export const UserProfile = () => { };

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
const MAX_ITEMS = 100;
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com';

// Types/Interfaces: PascalCase
interface UserData { }
type PostType = { };
```

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance (dependencies, configs)

### Examples

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat(search): add fuzzy search functionality"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(image): resolve Cloudinary URL generation"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat(api)!: change response format

BREAKING CHANGE: API responses now use camelCase instead of snake_case"
```

### Commit Message Best Practices

**DO**:
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Capitalize first letter
- No period at end
- Provide context in body if needed

**DON'T**:
- Write vague messages ("fix bug", "update")
- Combine unrelated changes
- Include WIP commits in PR

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Before submitting PR, test:

1. **Functionality**
   - Feature works as intended
   - No console errors
   - No visual regressions

2. **Responsiveness**
   - Test on mobile, tablet, desktop
   - Test different screen sizes

3. **Browsers**
   - Chrome
   - Firefox
   - Safari (if available)

4. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation works
   - Screen reader compatible
   - Sufficient color contrast

### MDX Validation

```bash
npm run validate:mdx
```

Ensures:
- Frontmatter schema compliance
- No syntax errors
- All required fields present

### Build Testing

```bash
# Production build
npm run build

# Check for build errors
# Check bundle size
npm run analyze
```
